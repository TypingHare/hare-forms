                Python is not among my favorite languages, as its type annotation system doesnâ€™t
                make sense to me. However, its concise syntax enables developers to write
                straightforward scripts and implement algorithms efficiently. I often use Python for
                tasks where it excels, but I would never choose it for building a heavy backend
                service.
