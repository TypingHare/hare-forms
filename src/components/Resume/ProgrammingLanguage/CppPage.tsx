                I've been working with C++ for the past two years. From the early days of wrestling
                with pointers and dreaded segmentation faults to creating my first game using SFML,
                it's been one of the steepest learning curves I've experienced. C++ feels like
                Doraemon's treasure bagâ€”packed with powerful features, some incredibly useful,
                others more like a devil's bargain.
            </Typography>
        </ResumeMainPage>
