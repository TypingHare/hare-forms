                My only experience with Kotlin was developing an Android app for coursework, though
                the project didn't turn out as well as I'd hoped, so I don't want to showcase it
                here. However, I'm very open to using Kotlin in the futureâ€”feel free to review my{' '}
                <JavaSkills /> as a reference.
            </Typography>
        </ResumeMainPage>
    )
